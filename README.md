# Pethero

## Overview
Are you tired of losing your pets and relying on outdated paper flyers to reunite you with your beloved animal? Look no further, Pethero is here to save the day. Pethero is an online platform where users can make posts about pets they have lost or pets they have found. If a User finds a lost pet, they can confirm on Pethero if the distinct feature that the pet owner submitted matches what we have in our database. If that infomation is correct, the lost pet status changes from lost to waiting and the pet owner is notified via email that their pet may have been found. 

Users must create an account with a valid email and verify that email to utilize Pethero services.
